1. Based on Author = displays a collaboration matrix between the author name.
2. Based on Affiliation = displays a collaboration matrix between affiliation.

**The "Order by"** dropdown is used to sort the appearance of the matrix. There are 4 types of order choices, namely:

1. Name (A-Z) = sort by alphabetical order name.
2. Highest Frequency = sort by the highest collaboration frequency.
3. Count Per Name = sort by number of collaborations per name.
4. Leaf Order = sort by proximity of collaboration values per name.

The first 25 collaborations are displayed.


### Minimum Requirement :

### Test Deploying an Application From the Command Line

1.	To download a copy of the 'matrix.war' application.
2.	Save the matrix.war file in the directory of your choice. This directory is referred to as *sample-dir*.
3.	Start Glassfish Server domain before deploy the application. To Start the Default Domain. Run the asadmin start-domain command without an operand: 

    **as-install/bin/asadmin start-domain**

    The command starts the default domain, domain1.

4.	Use the asadmin deploy command. General command is: 

    **as-install/bin/asadmin deploy war-name**

    To deploy the matrix.war sample, the command is:

    **as-install/bin/asadmin deploy sample-dir/matrix.war**
    
    Normally can be create in */domain1/applications/matrix/*

5.	Access the matrix application by typing the following URL in your browser:

    **http://localhost:8080/matrix**
    
6.	The application's start page is displayed.
